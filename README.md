# ECON5121A: Econometric Theory and Applications



### Year 2018

My lectures are based primarily on [Bruce Hansen's textbook](http://www.ssc.wisc.edu/~bhansen/econometrics/).

I have substantially updated my lecture notes this year to bring forward the teaching of R and demonstrate its use along with theory.

* [Lecture Notes](https://github.com/zhentaoshi/Econ5121A/tree/master/lec_notes_ipynb)


**Caveat**: This is an ongoing writing project.
The text is very incomplete, and must contain many errors.
**Use them at your own risk!**

I encourage anyone, in particular students taking my class, to contribute or improve the notes. Send me pull requests.
