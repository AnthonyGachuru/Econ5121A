This is a collection of lecture notes developed from my teaching of the
first-year gradate-level econometrics.  
They are companions of the in-class teaching,
but not substitute for lecture taking.

My lectures are based primarily on [Bruce Hansen's textbook](http://www.ssc.wisc.edu/~bhansen/econometrics/).

**Caveat**: This is an ongoing writing project not ready to publish.
The text is very incomplete, and must contain many errors. **Use them at your own risk!**
