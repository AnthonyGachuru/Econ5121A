## Lecture Notes

My lectures are based primarily on [Bruce Hansen's textbook](http://www.ssc.wisc.edu/~bhansen/econometrics/).

**Caveat**: This is an ongoing writing project.
The text is very incomplete, and must contain many errors.
**Use them at your own risk!**

I encourage anyone, in particular students taking my class, to contribute or improve the notes. Send me pull request.
