<h1 id="a-personal-recommendation-of-r">A Personal Recommendation of <strong>R</strong></h1>
<p>I have been using <strong>R</strong> since I started my postgraduate study in Peking University in 2005. <strong>R</strong> helps me with my daily research and teaching.</p>
<p><strong>R</strong> has many advantages. First, it inherits the standard program syntax from <strong>C</strong>. It is quick to learn for anyone with prior programming experience. Moreover, once you master <strong>R</strong>, it is easy to switch to other chosen language, if not <strong>R</strong>, in your workplace in the future.</p>
<p>Second, backed by a vast statistician community, <strong>R</strong> enjoys a large selection of packages, including the most recent ones. Indeed, once they publish a paper, statisticians often write and upload a companion package so that other researchers can adopt their methods.</p>
<p>Third, <strong>R</strong> is free. It was the primary reason that I chose it at the very beginning. In the era of open-source software, an algorithm written in <strong>R</strong> is much easier to share, test, and improve, since anyone can run the code on any platform, free of license and fee headache.</p>
<p><strong>R</strong> is not without limitations. For example, speed is a concern when running big and complex jobs. However, it will not be an issue in the problems that we will encounter in the first year postgraduate study.</p>
